UVA SOM requested a general-purpose workflow system, a tool that could handle frequent tweaks and ad-justments, because this domain is dominated by change. As many researchers are aware, a university’s review board is the perfect storm—a collision of science, bureaucratic processes, legal\nliability, and the progression of professional careers.",

Our first project automated the process of bringing labs back on line.  The approval process was complex and required multiple layers of approval, detailed documentation, and complex reports for rapidly changing state government regulations -- all of this multiplied by 100's of labs.  We built the application using the SpiffWorkflow library, and went live with the system on June 1st - and while there were certainly a few bugs, we continued to handle approval processes for over a year.

Doing what would normally take 6-8 months in 6-8 weeks! The team continued to pivot as our needs changed, all the while providing stellar customer service and virtual tech support as we ramped up our testing program at UVA."
